*Open Source Bible Interlinear* (*Alkitab Sumber Terbuka Interlinear*,
**ASTI**) is a project to provide interlinear Old Testament and New Testament
Bible in Indonesian language that's easy to access and distributable freely by
Benih Yang Baik.


## **Interlinear Bible in Digital Format**
At the same time, because there exist no known standard for a digital format of
interlinear Bible, ASTI also provides and advocates use of a interlinear Bible
digital format in two forms: (1) cheap to compute, (2) clear and easy to
understand.


## **Source**
1. Greek Text: [Byzantine Majority Greek New
   Testament](https://github/byztxt/byzantine-majority-text) by Robinson and
   Pierpoint.
2. Hebrew Text: [Open Scriptures' Hebrew
   Bible](https://github.com/openscriptures/morphhb) by Open Scriptures,
   Leningrad Westminster Codex.


## **Purpose**
1. Provides an open source interlinear Bible, mainly in digital format, in the
   Indonesian language.
2. Provides easy access for Indonesians to an interlinear Bible, mainly in
   digital format.
3. Spread the use of a human-readable interlinear Bible digital format based on
   UTF-8 that's easily convertible into other formats.

Every person has a right to access the Bible in its original language easily
and Lord Jesus desires for everyone to know Him as He is.


## **Steps**

- [ ] An interlinear format in two forms: (1) small in file size and (2) clear
  and easy to understand.
- [x] A tool to translate the original text to the target language as a desktop
  application and web application. Ready to use [source code
